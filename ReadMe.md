### About
CedroShell is a useless shell designed for personal education of Ruby in order to get used with specific concepts. Since I just started Ruby, I'm commonly practicing and making useless programs; this is one of them. CedroShell is also made to be modifiable and easy to modify so that others can use it for themselves!
